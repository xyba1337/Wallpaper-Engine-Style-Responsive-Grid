# Wallpaper-Engine-Styled Grid
This grid utilizes the bootstrap 4 framework in order to create a responsive grid with square images.
The image class styles, hover-transitions and captions are custom and purely made in css by me and inspired by wallpaper engines browse menu.
This was made out of pure boredem, you can feel free to integrate this into your project/s but make sure to leave credits to this repository.

The images are being randomly generated and dynamically rendered using vanilla javascript, the images are from: https://picsum.photos/
