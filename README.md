# Wallpaper-Engine-Styled Grid
This grid utilizes the bootstrap 4 framework in order to create a responsive grid with square images.
The image class styles, transitions and captions are custom made by me and inspired by the wallpaper engine browsing menu.
This was made out of pure bordem, you can feel free to integrate this into your project/s but make sure to leave credits to this repository.
